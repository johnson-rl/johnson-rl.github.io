### **_A personal web page_**
_This is a work in progress that illustrates my growth as a web developer._
## Skills to date:
1. html
2. css
3. Javascript
 * data types
 * functions
 * objects and arrays
 * DOM manipulation

## What is on the site:
Right now....a fully functional site!  It's basic, but I like it so far.  Also, there is definitely a cat.  That cat is named Juniper.  Juniper knows slightly less about coding than Ryan does.

## Future Updates:

* Add a footer
* Fix the pyramid display area so that it only loads once.  Make it more obvious where to click.
* Add more live examples of work.
* Play with color scheme - more modern would be better.
* Add additional images and content.  Improve some of the images I'm currently using.
